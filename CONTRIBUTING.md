# Contributing to imurun

Thank you for your interest in contributing to imurun! This document
explains how to report issues, propose changes, and what to expect from
the CI pipeline when you open a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to be respectful and professional in all
interactions — issues, pull requests, code reviews, and discussions.
Constructive feedback is welcome; personal attacks and dismissive
language are not.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report
template](https://github.com/ACCIDDA/imurun/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
when opening a new issue. It asks for a description, a minimal reprex,
your [`sessionInfo()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html) output,
and your operating system.

## Suggesting Features

Use the [feature request
template](https://github.com/ACCIDDA/imurun/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
Describe the use case and, if possible, how the feature fits into the
existing CLI workflow (read inputs -\> validate -\> run an imuGAP fit).
You can also open a blank issue if neither template fits.

## Submitting Changes

1.  **Fork & branch.** Create a feature branch off `main` (e.g.
    `fix/missing-input-message` or `feature/xlsx-input`).
2.  **Make your changes.** Follow the style conventions below.
3.  **Test locally.** Run `R CMD check` and the test suite before
    pushing (see the commands below).
4.  **Open a pull request** against `main` with a clear description of
    what changed and why.

### Local Development Commands

imurun is pure R — it has no compiled code and no Stan toolchain. It
imports [imuGAP](https://github.com/ACCIDDA/imuGAP), which installs as
an ordinary dependency (a binary where one is available).

``` sh
# Install the package locally
R CMD INSTALL --preclean .

# Regenerate documentation from roxygen comments
Rscript -e 'devtools::document()'

# Run the test suite
Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'

# Lint the package (config in .lintr)
Rscript -e 'lintr::lint_package()'

# Format the package (config in air.toml); requires the `air` binary
air format .

# Check spelling (config in inst/WORDLIST)
Rscript -e 'spelling::spell_check_package()'

# Build and check
R CMD build . && R CMD check imurun_*.tar.gz
```

### Style

- R code is linted with `lintr` (configuration in `.lintr`). Object
  names use `snake_case`; the bundled CLI script in `inst/scripts/` is
  excluded from linting because it is a standalone script.
- Formatting is handled by [air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/)
  (configuration in `air.toml`). Run `air format .` before committing.
- Do not hand-edit generated files: documentation under `man/` is
  produced by `roxygen2` from the roxygen comments in `R/`.

## What Happens When You Open a PR

Every pull request triggers four GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | What it does |
|----|----|
| **R-CMD-check** | Runs `R CMD check --as-cran` on Ubuntu (release, oldrel, devel) and Windows (release) — 4 jobs. The matrix is intentionally leaner than imuGAP’s because imurun is pure R (no compiled code). R-devel is allowed to fail without blocking the PR. |
| **lint** | Runs [`lintr::lint_package()`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/reference/lint.html) and fails the build on any lint. |
| **test-coverage** | Runs the test suite under `covr` and uploads coverage to Codecov. |
| **pkgdown** | Builds the documentation site. On PRs this is a build-only check (no deployment); the site is deployed to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`, published releases, and manual workflow dispatches. |

All workflows should pass before a PR is merged.
